# python_weather_APIs
In this example, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude 
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
